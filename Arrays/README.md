# Data Structure: Arrays

## Big O of Common Array Operations

I am going to calculate the time complexity of the following operations:

1. **Access**
   - **Time Complexity**: O(1)
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1)
2. **Set**
   - **Time Complexity**: O(1)
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1)
3. **Traverse/Search**
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n)
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1)
4. **Copy**
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n)
   - **Space Complexity**: O(n)
5. **Insert**:

   - At the beginning
     - **Time Complexity**: O(n)
   - At the end
   - if Dynamic :
     - **Time Complexity**: O(1)
   - if Static :

     - **Time Complexity**: O(2)

   - Somewhere in the middle
     - **Time Complexity**: O(n)

6. **Remove**:

   - At the beginning
   - At the end
   - Somewhere in the middle

   ## sort Squared Array

   - Think about the following

   - What would be the brute force way of solving this question ? What would be the Time and Space complexity of this approach?

   - Is there a better way to solve this with a more optimum Time complexity than the Brute force way ?

   - solve with Two Pointers
