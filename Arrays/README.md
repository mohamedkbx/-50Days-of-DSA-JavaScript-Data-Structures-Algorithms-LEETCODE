# Data Structure: Arrays

## Big O of Common Array Operations

I am going to calculate the time complexity of the following operations:

1. **Access**
   - **Time Complexity**: O(1)
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1)
2. **Set**
   - **Time Complexity**: O(1)
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1)
3. **Traverse/Search**
4. **Copy**
5. **Insert**:
   - At the beginning
   - At the end
   - Somewhere in the middle
6. **Remove**:
   - At the beginning
   - At the end
   - Somewhere in the middle
